Welcome to kotlin Basics 


Hello World programe in kotlin

fun main (){
    println("hello world")

// Kotlin variable //

/* Variable refers to a memory location. It is used to store data. The  data of variable can
be change and reused depending on condition or on information passed to the programe */

val name = "bhushan" 
// here the "val" is "value" it will be fixed when  assign the values

var marks = 28
marks = 30 
// here the var is "variable" it can be change over the time when needed

// IMPORTANT when assign the valu to the string you should always put the value in double inverted comma.

// To tell the data type to the programe 
fun main (){
    var lan:String
    lan = "Bhushan"
    println("your name is "+lan)
    // OR
    println("your name is $lan') 
}

/*Output  
  your name is Bhushan
  your name is Bhushan*/
